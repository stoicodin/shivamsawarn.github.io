## Abstract
This study delves into its application in investigating quantum state behaviors , focusing on coherent state and supeposition states. Coherent states characterised by classical-like characteristics, emerges as annihilation operator eigenstates with a well-defined phase. Superposition states, on the other hand, are quantum states that exist as a linear combination of several states, each with a matching probability amplitude. One significant use in the area of quantum error correction is the implementation of the Shor code for quantum error correction. It is possible to examine the impact of faults on the logical qubits and perform error correction operations by encoding quantum information into logical qubits. This research offer insights into the multifaceted utility of MZI (Mach-zhender interferrometer) and its relevance in the advancement of quantum technology.
