## Abstract
The present study delves into the application of investigating quantum state behavior, particularly focusing on coherent and superposition states. These states, characterized by their remarkable stability and precision, have found extensive utility in various domains of quantum mechanics and quantum information processing. The research accentuates the crucial role of quantum error correction (QEC) in ensuring the stability and re- liability of quantum information processing systems. By employing the Shor code, an error-correcting code devised by Peter Shor, it becomes feasible to detect and rectify errors that may arise during quantum computations. This research offer insights into the multifaceted utility of MZI (Mach-zhender interferrometer) and its relevance in the advancement of quantum technology.
