* Ongoing project in IBM Spring'23 after concluding [IBM QAMP Fall'22](https://www.credly.com/badges/8791e36e-864c-433a-9278-a5bbbf67316e/public_url) along with 5 collaborators

* Responsible for working out unitary and non-unitary part of Open Quantum Systems Dynamics.

* Responsible for protection and recovery reward of the agent required for reinforcement learning of
the non-unitary part of Schrodinger equation.

* Work on different noise models including Markovian and non-Markovian noises.

* Submitted checkpoints on [Github](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-22/issues/35) for fulfilment of the project.
