* Guide: Prof. R.P. Singh, Head, Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics(AMOPH) Division

* Working on `Simulation of Quantum Networks' and experimental techniques in a team setting.
* Familiarized myself with a variety of quantum network simulators such as QKDNetSim, QuISP, NetSquid, QuNetSim, SQUANCH, SeQUeNCe and SimulaQron and chose SeQUeNCe for its flexibility and scalability. 
* Analyzed the BB84 protocol within the SeQUeNCe simulator, conducting an in-depth study on throughput, error rates and latency which offered valuable insights into the potential and restrictions of quantum networks
* Working on three-node quantum network simulation and hands-on experimental techniques in Quantum Optics Lab.

* [Progress report](https://stoicodin.github.io/files/2023_SIP_Shivam.pdf)(<i>until 10 July</i>)
