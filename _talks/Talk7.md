* Ongoing project in IBM Spring'23 after concluding [IBM QAMP Fall'22](https://www.credly.com/badges/8791e36e-864c-433a-9278-a5bbbf67316e/public_url) along with 5 collaborators

* Worked out on proofreading of Unitary and non-Unitary part of Open Quantum Systems Dynamics and on different noise models including Markovian and non- Markovian noises.

* Responsible for applying different protection and recovery reward of the agent required for reinforcement learning of the non-unitary part of Schrodinger equation.

* Applied simple instances of open system on models like Quantum Boltzmann Machine(QBM) which showed perfect match between the probability generated and expected.

* Working on solving complex quantum open system through QITE models.

* Submitted checkpoints on [Github](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-22/issues/35) for fulfilment of the project.
