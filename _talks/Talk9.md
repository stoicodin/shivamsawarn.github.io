* Attended 3 weeks school and completed the [project](https://www.notebookarchive.org/predicting-the-electron-invariant-mass-from-the-cern-dielectron-collision-data--2022-01-5kbhz3u/) under a mentor.

* Explored various features of the di-electron collision using rigorous data analysis tools on a dataset consisting 100,000 dielectron events in the mass range 2-110 GeV.

* Used a custom neural network on test dataset for predicting the invariant mass of the electron.
